<p> In an effort to simplify the very long, ann engaging, short story of "the Garden of Forking Paths," i have decided to write a couple of summarizing links for the conveionance of the time-crunched reader. It is said that this story was the original inspiration for the HTML design system. However, what is truly explored is the vast miracle of the universe. In between the words of Jorge Borges there is a winding logic of dizzying height which seek to enlighten his readers.
