  <body>
    <p> Recounting his walk to Albert's house, Tsun recalls his ancestor Ts’ui Pên and the failure of his novel.Ts’ui Pên left a respectable job of a provincial govenor to write a novel and build an infinite maze. Unfortunately the universe could not gift him with the completion of his 13 year work when a monk stabbed him, que sera sera. Leaving a cryptic and unfinsihed novel, and no maze to speak of Ts’ui Pên, and his work, were left to anonymity. </p>
    <p>Tsun arrives at Albert's house and he is told by Albert about a Garden of Forked paths. Recounting to Albert that he was a descendent of Ts’ui Pên, an escitable Albert wishes to regale Tsun in his discovery. ALbert, a british national has discovered that the broken and inconsitent narrative of Ts’ui Pên's novel was not a product of poor writing. Imn fact, the novel itself is an excercise is metaphysical discovery in multiple (divergent) timeline theory. Through the chracters Ts’ui Pên is able to manipulate the story to create a wonderful maze of forked paths, determingin futures and live. Tsun is amazed by the idea of cosmic forces being dictated by individual actions, transforming the singular choice into infinite results. However, the Tsun resolves to complete his mission and prove a credit to his race for the Nazis. He shoots Albert in the head and is sentenced to hanging for espionnage and murder. the coincidence of Albert's death is that his name corresponds to an RAF airfeild that is later bombed after the event makes the paper.</p>
    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p> Following the first part's analysis this seciton focuses on the concept surrounding Git and HTML whihc is the concept of choices. The multiple universe theory prposes that among a myriad of choices that free-will individuals, and natural focres face, an evern more infinite set of universes can run in Tandem of the coninutation of one's own iniverse. The idea that one can go back on any mistake to update a program, a function of Git, or the ability to influence a program through HTML coding procedures run along the same narrative that little choices determine the outcome a product; sometimes in startling ways. </p>
